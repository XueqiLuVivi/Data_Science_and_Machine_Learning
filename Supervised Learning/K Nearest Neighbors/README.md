# K Nearest Neighbors
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique.

## Dataset
The data used for this model is a public data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

The data contains the following features:

-Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

-BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

-SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

-Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

-BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

-DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

-Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

## Task
In this project, I will build a KNN model from scratch and also use the knn model imported form scikit-learn. Then compare the result or these two models.
