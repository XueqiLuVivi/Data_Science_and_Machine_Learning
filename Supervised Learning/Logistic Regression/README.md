# Logistic Regression

## Task
In this project,I will use logistic regression model to predict whether or not a particular person has diabetes or not. The goal is to predict if a particular person has diabetes based on the features of the user.

## Dataset
The data used for this model is a public data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

The data contains the following features:

-Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

-BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

-SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

-Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

-BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

-DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

-Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0
