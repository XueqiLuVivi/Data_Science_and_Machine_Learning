# Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model. Parameters refer to coefficients in Linear Regression and weights in neural networks.

## Task
In this project, I will build a Gradient Descent model from scratch, using the gradient descent algorithm, by changing the learning rate and the number of iterations, to continuously reduce the value of the cost function, to find the most optimal linear equation.

## Dataset
Random generated numberical data.
