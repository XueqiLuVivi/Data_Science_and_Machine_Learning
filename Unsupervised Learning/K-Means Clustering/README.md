# K means Clustering

### Task
In this project I use the breast cancer dataset loaded from sklearn.datasets to cluster the two groups and found the center.

## Dataset

Attribute Information:

1) ID number 
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 

c) perimeter 

d) area 

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 

i) symmetry 

j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
